        <p style="font-size:17px">Good Kid consists of five members: lead vocalist Nick Frosst, drummer Jon Kereliuk, bassist Michael Kozakov, and guitarists David Wood and Jacob Tsafatinos. The band's mascot, known as Nomu Kid, is primarily featured in their marketing and social media. They released their first EP, titled Good Kid, in 2018. It was followed by Good Kid 2 two years later. In late 2020, the band gained popularity through the use of their music on Fortnite streams. The band has chosen not to issue DMCA strikes, so that their music could be used in streams. Multiple of their songs have since been added into the game.</p>
